<p>Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid!

        Red Leader... This is Gold Leader. We're starting out attack run. I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position. Stay in attack formation! The exhaust post is... marked and locked in! Switch power to front deflector screens. How many guns do you think, Gold Five. I'd say about twenty guns. Some on the surface, some on the towers. Death Star will be in range in five minutes. Switching to targeting computer. Computer's locked. Getting a signal. The guns...they've stopped! Stabilize your read deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters.
        
        And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.
        
        The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense. Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that? Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.
        
        Open up in there! Oh, no! There isn't any other way out. I can't hold them off forever! Now what? This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out? He's the brains, sweetheart. Well, I didn't... What the hell are you doing? Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy. Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it. Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!
